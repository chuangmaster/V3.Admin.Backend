# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`
**Language**: This plan MUST be written in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) per constitution requirements

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: C# 13 / .NET 9
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core 9, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer  
**Storage**: [Database to be specified - PostgreSQL recommended for user management]
**Testing**: xUnit, Moq for mocking, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing for integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
**Project Type**: Web API - ASP.NET Core backend service for v3-admin-frontend
**Performance Goals**: <200ms simple operations, <2000ms complex user/role/permission operations
**Constraints**: JWT authentication required, ApiResponseModel for all responses with HTTP status + business codes, Traditional Chinese error messages, role-based authorization, TraceId for distributed tracing
**Scale/Scope**: User account management system with role and permission management capabilities

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality Excellence**: ✅ C# 13 best practices, XML documentation, Traditional Chinese comments
**Three-Layer Architecture**: ✅ Controllers/Services/Repositories separation maintained
**Test-First Development**: ✅ Tests written before implementation, critical path coverage
**User Experience Consistency**: ✅ ApiResponseModel usage with HTTP status + business codes, standardized error handling, Traditional Chinese messages
**Performance & Security**: ✅ <200ms simple operations, JWT authentication, role/permission validation, input validation
**User Management Context**: ✅ Role-based access control, permission management, admin interface standards
**API Response Design**: ✅ Dual-layer design (HTTP status + business code), TraceId for distributed tracing

**Structure Decision**: C# ASP.NET Core three-layer architecture with Controllers (Presentation), Services (Business Logic), and Repositories (Data Access). All interfaces are placed in respective Interfaces folders to maintain clear separation of concerns.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
